**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary libraries:** `numpy` for numerical calculations and `scipy.optimize` for optimization.
2. **Define the `portfolio_optimization` function:**
- Takes asset returns (`returns`), risk aversion, and short-selling allowance as input.
- Calculates the covariance matrix of returns.
- Defines the objective function (`portfolio_variance`) to minimize.
- Sets constraints:
    - Sum of weights equals 1 (full investment).
    - Bounds on weights based on short-selling allowance.
- Performs optimization using `scipy.optimize.minimize`:
    - Employs the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm, suitable for constrained optimization.
    - Starts with an initial guess of equal weights.
- Calculates portfolio return and standard deviation using the optimal weights.
- Returns a dictionary containing optimal weights and portfolio statistics.
3. **Example Usage:**
- Demonstrates how to call the function with sample data and interpret the results.

**Key Points:**

- **Mean-Variance Optimization:** This code implements a core concept in portfolio optimization, finding weights that minimize risk (variance) for a given level of return.
- **Risk Aversion:** Allows customization based on the investor's risk appetite. Higher values indicate greater risk aversion.
- **Short Selling:** Provides the flexibility to allow or disallow short selling, significantly influencing the optimization outcome.
- **Constraints and Bounds:** Ensures realistic and feasible portfolio allocations.
- **Efficient Optimization:** Utilizes the powerful SLSQP algorithm for fast and accurate optimization.
- **Clear and Commented:** The code is extensively commented, explaining each step and the logic behind it.
